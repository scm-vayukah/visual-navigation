# 1080p Images Folder

This folder contains **resized input drone images** at 1080p resolution (1920x1080 pixels).

## Purpose

These images are generated by running `resize.py` to reduce the original drone image size for faster and more memory-efficient processing, especially useful for:
- Raspberry Pi
- Low-power systems
- Batch processing with `est1.py`

## Notes

- These images are used as input for `est1.py`.
- File names are currently hardcoded in scripts and must match.
